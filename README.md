SpellCorrectorGUI
SpellCorrectorGUI is a JavaFX-based spell correction application that allows users to input a word and receive a corrected version from a predefined dictionary. It uses a Trie data structure for efficient word lookup and incorporates Peter Norvig's and Levenshtein distance's spell correction algorithm. This project demonstrates the integration of JavaFX for GUI development with traditional Java data structures and advanced spell correction algorithms.

Features
Spell Correction: Provides corrected spelling suggestions for user-input words based on a dictionary.
Graphical User Interface: Easy-to-use GUI for entering words and displaying corrected suggestions.
Efficient Data Structure: Uses Trie data structure for fast word lookup and spell correction.
Project Structure
SpellCorrector: Handles the logic for correcting misspelled words.
Trie and TrieNode: Data structures used to store the dictionary and facilitate fast lookup of words.
SpellCorrectorGUI: Provides the JavaFX-based GUI for user interaction.
